This post is part of a series detailing my activities, thoughts and feelings as I make a five-week expedition across the beautiful lands of New Zealand (NZ).

`NOTE: there currently aren't any photos as the hostel I am staying in doesn't have the best upload speeds`

## Day 4 - Glowing with anticipation

- Early start
- smooth departure except some misunderstandings on baggage for other users
- being dropped off as the only passenger
- meeting my fellow adventurers, Zeus (instructor), Paul (ship inspector) and Cameron (software dev/sci-fi writer)
- taking the plunge
- clambering through
- jumping off waterfalls
- lectures in the dark
- luminescent maggots
- soup, bagels and overpriced photos
- unexpected trails
- a cheese scone
- An unexpected journey on the coach home
- New room mates

## day 5 - Getting to know New Zealand

- Early start
- the same coach driver with a working microphone
- brilliant background of what makes up the country
- micro-terracing from sheep
- a brief look around Paihia
- one on one tour to the Waitangi treaty grounds
- the past is in the past, lets move to the future
- Things in New Zealand aren't all roses and cotton candy
- A beautiful excursion out

## day 6 - Hobbiton

- Slow start to the day

- catching the coach to Matamata
- New podcast - self belief topic
- Listening to "it's not luck" 
  - The conflict cloud, what do I want? (right) What do they want? (left) What is the common objective? (centre)
  - Also, what does each party insist on to get what they want? inbetween each of the clouds and the common objective
- a mix up in destinations for someone.
