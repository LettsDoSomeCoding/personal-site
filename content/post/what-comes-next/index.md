# Starting simple with a Python CLI


## Which CLI library

### Typer

Initial choice as it seems simple but already customisation of naming and documentation requires extra typing so why is this better than click?

## Video editing in Python

### OpenCV

Most tutorials revolve around the use of this library to create a new video by capturing from a camera.
