I've not given enough love to this website in the last few years. So I'm coming back with more energy than ever and looking to enhance and add more content continuously going forward. This post will talk about what this content will consist of and the direction that the site will be driving towards in the future.

## No Longer a Travel Blog

Having been travelling for approximately a year, I found a much more manageable and streamlined format for blogging whilst travelling. This is [Polarsteps](https://www.polarsteps.com) a great app for tracking your journey and adding photos and thoughts as you go along. Thus I am copying my posts about my New Zealand travels in 2019 and adding them to Polarsteps in a retroactive fashion, therefore, I will not be completing that series on this site.

## How I Rebooted this Site

Although on the face of it this site hasn't changed, under the hood a lot has been tinkered, replaced and restructured. From failing deployments, to a lack of documentation, and just generally being unhappy with the quality of the project, plenty needed improvement. So the next post here will be all of the changes I have made and why I made them.

## What next?

I want this site to professionally represent me, whilst also highlighting my character and personality. In the short-term that will mean highlighting my technical experience, from both my career and personally, in particular the projects that I am currently working on, and what I've done in the past. Further down the line I will be adding wisdom from my work life that's about the human aspect of the job, and other lessons I've gained from outside of work.

I'm looking forward to writing it and I hope everyone enjoys reading it!
