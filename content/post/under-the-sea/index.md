## Day 20 - Picton to Ward

- Up early and cycling to the ferry
- passing cycling clubs
- slight pain in my knees still
- A nap and nice view on the ferry
- mix up getting off the ferry which meant dodging various motorbikes and moving traffic
- Change in the ferry terminal toilet
- Weather started out poor but soon became sunny and once I was over the first hill the Wineries started coming
- Small trails off here and there made the cycle quite pleasant
- Get to my motel and relax

## Day 21 - Ward to Kaikoura

- Late start intentionally
- Starts with rain again but clears just as I leave
- First glimpse of the mountains
- The range opens up into a valley
- I fall off
- Cycling on the still under construction coastal road
- Arriving in the delightful Albatross backpackers hostel
- Chatting with my room mates, Charles and Sarah, French and German Swiss
- Fush and Chups with washing and beach-side views
- Playing cards with our other room mate, Andrew, California

## Day 22 - Some unexpected guests

- Even the sober ones acted drunk
- Selfie time

## Day 23 - Swimming with Dolphins

- Up early for breakfast and leaving my bags at reception
- Get suited up, with prescription goggles
- All aboard
- Small pod with a couple dolphins, Dancing Queen wasn't a favourite for the locals
- Under the sea came to mind
- We get to a larger pod
- Roaring success, swimming around you, playing and having fun
- Shiveringly cold
- Salt in my mouth
- All worth it
- I chill out at the hostel afterwards, shower, book things, attempt to watch the superbowl
